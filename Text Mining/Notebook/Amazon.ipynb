              "[\"\\ni was using macbook air early 2015 before. It was performing ok since i purchased until 2022. But i started facing unexpected shutdown due to poor battery condition. hence i upgraded to M1 Mac in exchange offer. I got around 18k exchange value which was surprising for me.After i started using this i fell in love with this due to following pros1. Excellent battery life (mora than 12 hours continues usage)2. Excellent performance compared to my previous macbook 2015 model (more than 200% bump in performance i felt)3. Excellent display qualityI did not feel any cons during my usage on past 6 months. Only concern is screen is ultra-fingerprint magnet. You need a cleaning cloth always with you which I am carrying with me all the time with IPA liquid for better cleaning performance. But i did not felt about it compared to the performance it was given. Also fingerprint wont be noticeable if the screen is onI thought of buying a screen card for mac (actually I purchased on amazon) to protect form fingerprint. Luckily it was damaged on transit. After that again I did some research and found lot of articles was saying using screen card will void display warranty of mac and screen card will eliminate the small gap given between the screen and keyboard while it closed which will lead to lid will not close properly or addition pressure will be put on screen while it closed which may damage the screen. Hence, I claimed refund instead of replacement product and purchased IP liquid to clean the screen.If you're a frequent traveler along with MacBook, you may notice keyboard marks on screen which may become permanent if it's not cleaned periodically. So, I purchased IP liquid and microfiber cloth to maintain it. It costs me around 200 for both (250ml vetro power IP liquid in amazon and microfiber cloth from DMART). I believe this will last me at least for a year or 2 which is sufficient for me to get another pair of this cleaning product instead of buying 1000+ rupees screen card. This liquid is useful in cleaning my other gadgets as well also during the Screen card installation on my own with cheaper option available online compared to products available in local market with 200+ rupees which is available online for 100+ rupees\\n\",\n",

              " \"\\nThis is my first Macbook. I needed a personal laptop with the following requirements -1. It should have long battery life. I should spend less time being anxious about battery and more time actually focusing on doing some work with it for long hours. This device makes you forget worrying about battery.2. It should wake up quickly/instantly from sleep, like how a tablet feels always ready to use. Imagine a situation when a question pops up in your mind that you've been encountering for long and thought of bookmarking it or letting it's tab sit on your open browser session, in such moments a mere 5-10 sec wake time will make you hesitant to reach your laptop, specially if ideas keep springing in your head multiple times a day. With Macbook, you open the lid and you're productive already!3. It should be fast while multitasking and switching tabs.I was initially skeptical with the 8 GB RAM thing, having experienced how quickly 16 GB fills up in windows with multiple browser windows and tabs open. Still decided to give it a shot, and man this thing doesn't disappoint.But it's not all perfect. There are multiple issues I faced -1. Using an external 2K 24-inch display delivers pathetic experience. The  rendered text is unpleasant to read and the icons sent are not retina versions, they look bad. Having been spoilt by the excellent ClearType on Windows and noticing minute visual details by habit, I have a very bothersome time everytime I wake it up. Dear Apple, please provide subpixel rendering or a ClearType equivalent, it's much needed. Though at present, there are some software workarounds that could help to an extent by rendering retina visuals on non-retina displays, for eg. BetterDummy (supports M1).2. The mouse pointer is annoyingly jittery. My setup goes like this - Lenovo Q24h-10 connected via USB-C to MBA, one USB port of the monitor's USB hub connected to Lenovo 300 FHD webcam, the other USB port (with support for USB BC spec) connected to an ORICO 4-port USB 3 powered hub (the external power is not connected though), and the wireless dongle of Dell KM636 connected to the hub. The setup works like a charm with Windows on a Dell Latitude, even with Samsung Dex, but somehow with the Mac, the mouse cursor is very jumpy and the experience is annoying to the point that it's unusable. Things are better if the dongle is connected directly to the other USB C port of the Mac though, via an adapter. They are also somewhat better after enabling some option related to power on the monitor's OSD, and using MOS software on Mac, but the jumpiness is still present.Rating it 5 stars for what it's designed to do.\\n\",\n",

              " \"\\nI upgraded from a 2017 Acer Aspire Intel i3 Laptop (256GB SSD + 1TB + 8GB). And after the first day of usage, my mind is blown. Yes, I paid a hefty amount for the Air (Rs 76K with an exchange, Amazon took my old laptop for Rs 8800).Display: 13.3 inches may feel small initially for those shifting from 15.6 or bigger screen sizes. Honestly, I'm already used to it in a day. Unlike my Acer, the screen is brilliant. Great viewing angles, crisp and the brightness is adaptive. I don't have to keep adjusting brightness levels all the time, the sensor takes care of it. Speakers are excellent for this form factor, they even have a very mild base.Performance: It's off the charts. This M1 chip has 5nm transistor spacing making the laptop incredibly efficient. Plus it comes with 8 cores so multi-tasking is a breeze. I have about 10 chrome tabs, and 5 other windows open and it provided over 12 hours of battery life. Performance is flawless, it doesn't lag, no stutters, not even a hint of retard while navigating through apps.Keyboard and trackpad: Trackpad is large. You can adjust levels of trackpad sensitiveness to your touch. A nice feature to have. The clicks are very satisfying as well. The keyboard is backlit, and the key travel is perfect. Takes absolutely zero effort to get used to the keyboard and trackpad.OS: The laptop comes with Big Sur OS and right from the get-go you get the option to upgrade to Monterey which took about 20 minutes on my 50gbps internet speed.Lastly, Amazon delivery was good this time. I had ordered a Lenovo 2 months ago and Amazon took 10 days to tell me that the product was damaged in transit. However, this time, Amazon delivered my Macbook Air in 1.5 days.Update: The charger gets very hot and I can feel a very mild current (almost like a vibration) on the flap when the laptop is plugged in. This happened on my Acer also. Anybody else facing with this?\\n\",\n",
              " \"\\nIt's a very laptop 💻 but here are some of my observations.Screen: The screen is realy amazing movies watching and whatever task you do like reading PDFs, browsing images etc. It's a pleasant experience to eyes .Battery: Although they claim for 15-16 hours of battery life but in real time usage this has been a lot less than the claimed.On the first initial days I was getting about 8-9 hours of battery life which I guess is still good in this price range .i thought there is any manufacturing defect in my air's battery hardware. But the screen brightness and the task you're performing plays important role in deciding battery life of the laptop.On less than 50% brightness and very light task I was able to get around 12 hours of battery backup and I'm happy with that .Performance : I'm an engineering student and do a lot of development work . So if you're into development you can blindly purchase it . The productivity it provides is justifiable to its price .Keyboard and Trackpad: This is probably the best trackpad in the laptops not comparing it with pro macbooks but better than almost all windows laptops. However the keyboard can be considered a very good keyboard but not the best . But it gives you a satisfactory feeling of typing.Verdict: It's been a month of using this laptop and I'm very satisfied . Will update this review after 2 months.\\n\",\n",

What surprised me, was the response from Amazon customer care. They said if there is any issue with Apple products bought from Amazon, you need to first present it to the Apple store within the replacement period, i.e. 7 days. Apple store should give a certificate telling that there is an issue with the product. Amazon will consider replacement only in this case.I asked them why is this not mentioned on the page promising 7 day replacement, to which they said that not all clauses can be mentioned in the Amazon website!! So, even if the screen is broken or for any other serious issues with laptop, you need to take an appointment and go to Apple store and get their approval for replacement.So, the 7 day replacement guarantee does not mean much for Apple products bought from Amazon. Better avoid buying apple products from Amazon.\\n',\n",

After going through tons of videos that compares 8gb air vs 16gb there was a clear evidence that with my use i can still be happy with the m1 8gb ram variant.This is not a long term review but i shall update the review after few months of usage.Why i opted for 8gb ram?My use is browsing some secure pages, maybe watch some videos too. Use imovies to edit small videos (not heavy 4k long videos as such) but i have seen that this can support even editing 4k videos. But then definitely if you are someone who use it majorly for editing 4k videos then you should probably get the 16gb variant. Then i do a little bit of coding too.I do have a office laptop that is a 16gb ram intel one. I did try opening some youtube 4k vids in chrome and compared it side by side and initial impression is pretty good on how the m1 takes on the load. But I should wait for more to get the actual picture.So, if you are light user with basic use and not into gaming or anything. This laptop is gonna be more than enough for your use. As its very much portable and light weight. The battery is also heavily optimised. ( i tried all these and i am yet to do my initial charging 😊).I shall update my review after 3-6 months for a better comparison.***update after 10 months *****No regrets! This is super fast engine.

If one is used for charging and the other is used to connect the mouse then virtually you are left with no other port for a pen drive or printer. There is space where they could have given more ports.What I liked the most was the reduced bezels and scissors on the keyboard due to which the size of the laptop got reduced without compromising the 13.3-inch screen size.  The screen is good, speed is fast, and beauty has increased, however, some may miss the glowing apple logo which has been replaced with a metal Apple logo.

If and if only Apple sells its Macbooks for Windows operating system, it would be really a 10 STAR device.Pros:* Excellent SOC (System on chip) which is beyond any comparison. Intel and AMD have been left milesbeyond. Their processors are antiquated & far short in performance.* The processor does not generate any heat - which indicates the cool operation and also low powerconsumption. There is no cooling fan in the laptop. The entire unit is sealed as there is no heat venting.* Battery lasts very loooong, even for HQ 16 K video playback.* Display is very realistic with true colours.* Sound quality is great. Channel separation is so good, you feel theatre like effect with soundscoming from all directions, far and near.Cons:* Very poor or no scope for expanding the RAM and storage size.* Software is expensive.* Additional compatible peripherals are mighty expensive.* Such pricey laptops come with only 1 year warranty.* Other than 2 C type ports and a earphone jack nothing else is present. One C port is engaged forpower supply. Thus one has inflexibility of having to do with only one H.Speed \"C\" type USB port.* Windows users switching to Apple are cautioned.

So no surprizes the laptop comes in a nice packaging, (thanks to amazon for there on time and easy delivery).

No consIt's the best version of any Macbooks till date.To be honest, I do multiple things- I design, I edit videos, I code, and I browse. Everything is good. I wish I could have ordered a bigger storage one though which was a bit expensive for me. So I treated myself with a very handy Seagate SSD 500 GB and I use it on the fly.

For longer workloads - like if you are doing daily large video compressions/conversions and that takes like 15-20 mins, then this machine will not work as fast as Pro; as that's not the load it's optimised for.

              "'\\ni was using macbook air early 2015 before. it was performing ok since i purchased until 2022. but i started facing unexpected shutdown due to poor battery condition. hence i upgraded to m1 mac in exchange offer. i got around 18k exchange value which was surprising for me.after i started using this i fell in love with this due to following pros1. excellent battery life (mora than 12 hours continues usage)2. excellent performance compared to my previous macbook 2015 model (more than 200% bump in performance i felt)3. excellent display qualityi did not feel any cons during my usage on past 6 months. only concern is screen is ultra-fingerprint magnet. you need a cleaning cloth always with you which i am carrying with me all the time with ipa liquid for better cleaning performance. but i did not felt about it compared to the performance it was given. also fingerprint wont be noticeable if the screen is oni thought of buying a screen card for mac (actually i purchased on amazon) to protect form fingerprint. luckily it was damaged on transit. after that again i did some research and found lot of articles was saying using screen card will void display warranty of mac and screen card will eliminate the small gap given between the screen and keyboard while it closed which will lead to lid will not close properly or addition pressure will be put on screen while it closed which may damage the screen. hence, i claimed refund instead of replacement product and purchased ip liquid to clean the screen.if you\\'re a frequent traveler along with macbook, you may notice keyboard marks on screen which may become permanent if it\\'s not cleaned periodically. so, i purchased ip liquid and microfiber cloth to maintain it. it costs me around 200 for both (250ml vetro power ip liquid in amazon and microfiber cloth from dmart). i believe this will last me at least for a year or 2 which is sufficient for me to get another pair of this cleaning product instead of buying 1000+ rupees screen card. this liquid is useful in cleaning my other gadgets as well also during the screen card installation on my own with cheaper option available online compared to products available in local market with 200+ rupees which is available online for 100+ rupees\\n \\n1)screen: great.2)keyboard & trackpad: good and great.3)battery life: for web and coding=10+ hrs.  for video editing=4-5hrs.4)charging=1.5hrs5)webcam=bad.6)silent= so cool to operate that it does not heatup and due to this, it does not have any fan inside.7) maintenance: due to not having a fan, it does not pull any dust from the surrounding= great.8) build quality= solid.9) speakers = best front-facing surround sound speakers after m1 macbook pro(2021).\\n \\nvalue for money laptopif u r looking for programming this is the oneit has better power efficiency,better screen quality, smooth & fast ui &  small in sizem1 is  still better option...  m2  is good but  i think  there is no huge improvement between  m2 & m1  soo  if u hava 80k go for m1 mac instead of m2  if  u have high budget  go  for  pro model\\'s dont go for basic ones\\n \\ncamera quality not good\\n \\nloved everything about this one. this one was a love at first sight but took me years to buy. i am really happy with the delivery and genuineness and it was worth it for inr 82,990. thank you amazon.\\n  \\nexcellent macbook air with an excellent configuration for the office or home. if anybody is looking for a chance to buy a new macbook then surely i would recommend this one as it works very smoothly.\\n \\nhinge issues... sometimes don\\'t open by single handed... rest everything is heaven\\n \\neverything is awesome except camera and charging speed, for these two factors, one can go for m2 air, those 20k worth it, for future scope. i don\\'t think read write speed would have that deep impact.\\n \\nbought 2 of these for air and pro macs and fits perfectly for both, image attached.\\n \\ngud superpower delivery by amazon on time\\n \\nthis macbook light weight, battery capacity is quite good ,upto 13 hrs. software are running smoothly.  web cam is quality is good. screen quality is good.\\n \\nnice product by apple\\n \\nmac user since last 7 yrs and this is too relevant even in 2022\\n \\nit is so faster than windows laptop. and download and upload are just a click away. i was using windows now became a macbook user and i am fully satisfied with macbook air m1.it\\'s a total different machine for windows users but it is faster and secure than windows.. just go for it.....\\n \\nm1 chip is simply amazing.i use final cut pro (for video editing) and it glides through 4k footage(that too with multiple layers of 4k footage).super satisfied ... and that too at  rs.78,990(in sale with card discounts)huge value-for-money product.\\n \\nvalue buy from amazon\\n \\nloved every bit of this gorgeous laptop. the screen, sound quality, touch, and keypad are amazing.\\n \\nsuperb product!with this macbook i have fully become a member of the apple ecosystem.happy about it.thanks amazon♥️\\n \\n                    the media could not be loaded.\\n                \\xa0liked the product\\n \\nthe battery backup is just awesome as it easily lasts me for more than a day with non-stop browsing and surfing the internet and use of google chrome.\\n \\nnothing can beat apple . rose cold colour is awesome, so me . it is so so sleek and perfect . goes with my personality\\n \\nthis is my first macbook. i needed a personal laptop with the following requirements -1. it should have long battery life. i should spend less time being anxious about battery and more time actually focusing on doing some work with it for long hours. this device makes you forget worrying about battery.2. it should wake up quickly/instantly from sleep, like how a tablet feels always ready to use. imagine a situation when a question pops up in your mind that you\\'ve been encountering for long and thought of bookmarking it or letting it\\'s tab sit on your open browser session, in such moments a mere 5-10 sec wake time will make you hesitant to reach your laptop, specially if ideas keep springing in your head multiple times a day. with macbook, you open the lid and you\\'re productive already!3. it should be fast while multitasking and switching tabs.i was initially skeptical with the 8 gb ram thing, having experienced how quickly 16 gb fills up in windows with multiple browser windows and tabs open. still decided to give it a shot, and man this thing doesn\\'t disappoint.but it\\'s not all perfect. there are multiple issues i faced -1. using an external 2k 24-inch display delivers pathetic experience. the  rendered text is unpleasant to read and the icons sent are not retina versions, they look bad. having been spoilt by the excellent cleartype on windows and noticing minute visual details by habit, i have a very bothersome time everytime i wake it up. dear apple, please provide subpixel rendering or a cleartype equivalent, it\\'s much needed. though at present, there are some software workarounds that could help to an extent by rendering retina visuals on non-retina displays, for eg. betterdummy (supports m1).2. the mouse pointer is annoyingly jittery. my setup goes like this - lenovo q24h-10 connected via usb-c to mba, one usb port of the monitor\\'s usb hub connected to lenovo 300 fhd webcam, the other usb port (with support for usb bc spec) connected to an orico 4-port usb 3 powered hub (the external power is not connected though), and the wireless dongle of dell km636 connected to the hub. the setup works like a charm with windows on a dell latitude, even with samsung dex, but somehow with the mac, the mouse cursor is very jumpy and the experience is annoying to the point that it\\'s unusable. things are better if the dongle is connected directly to the other usb c port of the mac though, via an adapter. they are also somewhat better after enabling some option related to power on the monitor\\'s osd, and using mos software on mac, but the jumpiness is still present.rating it 5 stars for what it\\'s designed to do.\\n \\nthanks to amazon for quick and safe delivery 🙏this is my first macbook from apple, the screen quality is good as i expectedthe sound quality is amazing, with a  real dolby and surround sound from the speakers. 👌the trackpad is quite interesting, i have never seen a such trackpad on any other laptop, 👍overall it is good to buy, go for it without hesitation.👍\\n \\nit\\'s awesome.\\n \\nbest laptop till date and unbeatable desgin and specs in today moder world as well . anywhere you can see its the best and no.1 choice laptop still and yes it desrves it as the name says macbook is macbook .. apple products does true to their desgin n specs.  loved the ui and user experience of apple product especially macbook is totally different from any other product\\n \\ni upgraded from a 2017 acer aspire intel i3 laptop (256gb ssd + 1tb + 8gb). and after the first day of usage, my mind is blown. yes, i paid a hefty amount for the air (rs 76k with an exchange, amazon took my old laptop for rs 8800).display: 13.3 inches may feel small initially for those shifting from 15.6 or bigger screen sizes. honestly, i\\'m already used to it in a day. unlike my acer, the screen is brilliant. great viewing angles, crisp and the brightness is adaptive. i don\\'t have to keep adjusting brightness levels all the time, the sensor takes care of it. speakers are excellent for this form factor, they even have a very mild base.performance: it\\'s off the charts. this m1 chip has 5nm transistor spacing making the laptop incredibly efficient. plus it comes with 8 cores so multi-tasking is a breeze. i have about 10 chrome tabs, and 5 other windows open and it provided over 12 hours of battery life. performance is flawless, it doesn\\'t lag, no stutters, not even a hint of retard while navigating through apps.keyboard and trackpad: trackpad is large. you can adjust levels of trackpad sensitiveness to your touch. a nice feature to have. the clicks are very satisfying as well. the keyboard is backlit, and the key travel is perfect. takes absolutely zero effort to get used to the keyboard and trackpad.os: the laptop comes with big sur os and right from the get-go you get the option to upgrade to monterey which took about 20 minutes on my 50gbps internet speed.lastly, amazon delivery was good this time. i had ordered a lenovo 2 months ago and amazon took 10 days to tell me that the product was damaged in transit. however, this time, amazon delivered my macbook air in 1.5 days.update: the charger gets very hot and i can feel a very mild current (almost like a vibration) on the flap when the laptop is plugged in. this happened on my acer also. anybody else facing with this?\\n \\nit\\'s a very laptop 💻 but here are some of my observations.screen: the screen is realy amazing movies watching and whatever task you do like reading pdfs, browsing images etc. it\\'s a pleasant experience to eyes .battery: although they claim for 15-16 hours of battery life but in real time usage this has been a lot less than the claimed.on the first initial days i was getting about 8-9 hours of battery life which i guess is still good in this price range .i thought there is any manufacturing defect in my air\\'s battery hardware. but the screen brightness and the task you\\'re performing plays important role in deciding battery life of the laptop.on less than 50% brightness and very light task i was able to get around 12 hours of battery backup and i\\'m happy with that .performance : i\\'m an engineering student and do a lot of development work . so if you\\'re into development you can blindly purchase it . the productivity it provides is justifiable to its price .keyboard and trackpad: this is probably the best trackpad in the laptops not comparing it with pro macbooks but better than almost all windows laptops. however the keyboard can be considered a very good keyboard but not the best . but it gives you a satisfactory feeling of typing.verdict: it\\'s been a month of using this laptop and i\\'m very satisfied . will update this review after 2 months.\\n \\ngood quality\\n \\nlove the laptop. excellent overall features.\\n \\ni had fears about getting a laptop with passive cooling, even though i don\\'t do video editing or compile big programs on the air, even for web development and writing small scripts a fanless laptop seemed like a bad idea but after using this i can this thing is totally fine and wonderfuldocker works fine some issues do come up but for simple development of c++, python apps along with postgres sql docker with some configurations the m1 chip has so far caused no issues.i run vscode, pycharm the project is not too huge but with safari or chrome running with 6-8 tabs this wonder does not heat up or cause any instability.the display is the best i have used so far, the speakers are far better than equivalent windows laptopssome cons:1) no simple keyboard shortcut to control keyboard backlighting,2) as a long-term windows user, the shortcuts like arrow key + win key to resize apps/stack apps is something i truly miss, mac does have its own multitasking/split screen way but i prefer windows installing a third party for this seems unnecessary3) battery life on 12.4 is a bit less than when i got the macbook air4) switching to mac shortcuts takes a bit of time5) need to buy a type c dongle, as i work of ethernet port mostly\\n \\nthis laptop is not having smc options as we have in intel- macbook.\\n \\nthere is no dislike in apple product\\n \\nthis is the device that got me into apple ecosystem, and this is a piece of peak engineering and worth every rupee i spent.no fans means the inside is completely isolated from the outside so no dust inside.speakers and display are top notch. you can go for mi notebook with similar screen resolution but this one does not cause eye strain.trackpad is one of the best i used.battery life is unreal.not for gaming though. if you are using it for just media consumption and some general programming then you will not feel it getting hot ever.considering the price difference between m1 and m2 models, this is a better choice if you do not want to spend nearly 50% more on m2 air.\\n  \\ndont waste time reading reviews, go for it .its superb!!\\n \\nif you are looking for a personal computer for normal work. this is the machine for you. amazing battery life and speakers. still holds perfect compared to other computers in segment.\\n \\ni have been using the macbook 13,3 inches for almost a year now. it works extremely fast and is very smooth, the keys are great to type on. though it has a good software and mostly good hardware, the camera quality is horrible. its very blocky and the pixels are extremely visible. for the price, you can maybe get a better windows laptop but i have been a hardcore apple fan.overall, i give it a 4.5 out of 5, it runs extremely smoothly even with multiple windows,tabs,apps etc open. my favourite part is the constant updates that apple provides that always upgrade the features and exemplify the user experience! i hope this helps =d.\\n \\nbuying apple laptop is an investment for me. if you have money then please go for it. it will give you great productivity. battery life is awesome.do not buy it for watching youtube and movies (ignore this if you are parents rich).\\n \\ni faced a small issue related to the new macbook air i bought from amazon. i was considering whether to request for replacement or not and i called amazon customer care. what surprised me, was the response from amazon customer care. they said if there is any issue with apple products bought from amazon, you need to first present it to the apple store within the replacement period, i.e. 7 days. apple store should give a certificate telling that there is an issue with the product. amazon will consider replacement only in this case.i asked them why is this not mentioned on the page promising 7 day replacement, to which they said that not all clauses can be mentioned in the amazon website!! so, even if the screen is broken or for any other serious issues with laptop, you need to take an appointment and go to apple store and get their approval for replacement.so, the 7 day replacement guarantee does not mean much for apple products bought from amazon. better avoid buying apple products from amazon.\\n \\nits been a month of using the macbook air and here is my honest review:- great battery backup. can easily do work like video editing, gaming for 6-7 hours- great speaker quality- great screen and display- loved the fit and finish overall as it apple\\n \\nshould i buy the 16gb ram from apple store? this was the question i had for a long time. after going through tons of videos that compares 8gb air vs 16gb there was a clear evidence that with my use i can still be happy with the m1 8gb ram variant.this is not a long term review but i shall update the review after few months of usage.why i opted for 8gb ram?my use is browsing some secure pages, maybe watch some videos too. use imovies to edit small videos (not heavy 4k long videos as such) but i have seen that this can support even editing 4k videos. but then definitely if you are someone who use it majorly for editing 4k videos then you should probably get the 16gb variant. then i do a little bit of coding too.i do have a office laptop that is a 16gb ram intel one. i did try opening some youtube 4k vids in chrome and compared it side by side and initial impression is pretty good on how the m1 takes on the load. but i should wait for more to get the actual picture.so, if you are light user with basic use and not into gaming or anything. this laptop is gonna be more than enough for your use. as its very much portable and light weight. the battery is also heavily optimised. ( i tried all these and i am yet to do my initial charging 😊).i shall update my review after 3-6 months for a better comparison.***update after 10 months *****no regrets! this is super fast engine. i do a lot of coding now with this. i feel every software works like a charm in m1 now. of course we have the updated processor now. this is a start of a super powerful engine\\n \\nhonest review!if you ever dream a laptop with fastest ever in terms of speed while opening the screen, no lag, quality (picture and sound) the performance, highly top notch! i will never ever buy windows laptop at all. apple is just out of the world!\\n \\ni got a golden one. it is rose gold and not truly gold in colour but its looks are mesmerising. the performance is cool. the only drawback is that there are only two type c ports. if one is used for charging and the other is used to connect the mouse then virtually you are left with no other port for a pen drive or printer. there is space where they could have given more ports.what i liked the most was the reduced bezels and scissors on the keyboard due to which the size of the laptop got reduced without compromising the 13.3-inch screen size.  the screen is good, speed is fast, and beauty has increased, however, some may miss the glowing apple logo which has been replaced with a metal apple logo. speaker is crisp loud and clear.i like it\\n \\nm1 is phenomenal in terms of performance and efficiency. it just works without any hiccups. battery life is excellent. easily a two day laptop with light to moderate use. if you are in the apple ecosystem, go for it with eyes closed.moreover, almost all apps have a universal binary now which targets arm architecture specifically (instead of x86), which basically means more performance in all of these apps. so if you used this laptop more than a year ago and found bugs with the software, be rest assured that the bugs are no more and macos is very stable now on this machine.\\n \\nvalue based buying improved performance compared to old macbooks\\n \\nprobably the best productivity gadget in this price segment (so called pro phones cost more than this). has great display, one of the best speaker, super portability and bunch of useful, yet free apple softwares. for personal use this is just appropriate. though it has 8 gbs of ram; i tried garageband with my midi keyboard, multiple hd video editing in imovie and it worked almost perfectly. and the best part is wake up feature. no matter how many days after i open the lid, the screen wakes up for action just instantly. truely this feature is amazing.p.s. amazon did not accept my old laptop for exchange, despite it being in working condition; saying the battery backup needs to be at least 1 hour. my old laptop was an hcl one, that they agreed on. and hcl stopped production 4 years ago. how can you ask for 1 hour of backup from such a laptop ... 🤣\\n \\nawesome products. unbelievably fast and responsive. it would take a day or two to get accustomed if you are moving from windows to mac.\\n \\nbox received unsealed, charging adapter and charging cable is missing from the box.\\n \\nbattery backup is great, overall performance is also good.\\n \\nwhat to say about the macbook. the name is enough in itself. the laptop battery life is astounding. it remains super cool in winters as it has aluminium body.what we expect more from apple is an inbuilt ms office for macbook\\n \\nit is worth investing in mac because it gives whole new experience of using a laptop.\\n \\napple macbook m1 2020 edition is an excellent piece of hardware bundle but the software platform is not suitable for many of the applications which work only on windows pc. if and if only apple sells its macbooks for windows operating system, it would be really a 10 star device.pros:* excellent soc (system on chip) which is beyond any comparison. intel and amd have been left milesbeyond. their processors are antiquated & far short in performance.* the processor does not generate any heat - which indicates the cool operation and also low powerconsumption. there is no cooling fan in the laptop. the entire unit is sealed as there is no heat venting.* battery lasts very loooong, even for hq 16 k video playback.* display is very realistic with true colours.* sound quality is great. channel separation is so good, you feel theatre like effect with soundscoming from all directions, far and near.cons:* very poor or no scope for expanding the ram and storage size.* software is expensive.* additional compatible peripherals are mighty expensive.* such pricey laptops come with only 1 year warranty.* other than 2 c type ports and a earphone jack nothing else is present. one c port is engaged forpower supply. thus one has inflexibility of having to do with only one h.speed \"c\" type usb port.* windows users switching to apple are cautioned. compatibility, storage space, expandability areseverely constrained.finally, like the pc\\'s which can take ms windows os and also other os platforms, apple range of macbooks should also be compatible universally for all platforms, with hardware expandability options like pcs.with any operating systems.\\n \\ni was a bit hesitant to switch from windows to mac, however, the transition has been seamless. the user interface and software optimization is excellent. absolutely loved it!!!\\n \\nthe m1 macbook is really fast\\n \\nsuch a great purchase after a long time waiting, really value for many product.\\n \\ngood computer, but the weight and booting time are more than expected.\\n \\nnice\\n \\nexcellent quality laptop except camera quality.\\n \\nbattery life (15hrs) is like nothing i have seen before but this is only if u run native apps or the ones optimised otherwise it will drain quickly but still manage to give you around 10 hrs. screen and audio  is ek number. number of ports is a bummer though. m lovin it...\\n \\nhi, i have been an apple user- still have an old 2011 model. then i switched back to dell for around 4 years. it\\'s all good and smooth with dell. and very recently i thought let me buy myself an air. i like that its super sleek and somehow grey color is one of my favourites. so no surprizes the laptop comes in a nice packaging, (thanks to amazon for there on time and easy delivery). the only con of apple air is that its pricey but yes (if you are like me-you will realise its soon that in a long run, how this becomes such an important part of your life, its much more cheaper in value)super pro\\'s1. m1 processors are highly efficient in processing. also thanks to ssd2. battery life is crazy- last for 15-16 hours easily3. look and design (there\\'s not much to say- its very obvious)- super classy, sleek and very light weight.con\\'s1. no consit\\'s the best version of any macbooks till date.to be honest, i do multiple things- i design, i edit videos, i code, and i browse. everything is good. i wish i could have ordered a bigger storage one though which was a bit expensive for me. so i treated myself with a very handy seagate ssd 500 gb and i use it on the fly. something extra to carry but i still love it.also, to let you know that- this is one of my first review that\\'s written so throughly. so understand the excitement and satisfaction level of this product.wish you luck! now go and buy. :)\\n \\ninsanely powerful and starkly, very efficient too. easily lasts a week after full charging. the m1 is a beast and handles everything smoothly. the finish, feel and look is top notch premium just as you expect from apple products. the display is gorgeous crisp and has a high contrast, the sound quality is excellent too.  its really the best laptop not just at this price point but even above. this is a machine you should buy if you are looking for a laptop at this price range. apple just makes beautiful powerful machines and this one is just on another level. the m1 chip is a revolution. yes there’s a learning curve when you switch from windows to macintosh but nothing which can’t be learnt. unless you are really bent on using windows only, this is the laptop to go for.\\n \\nclose your eyes and buy this macbook air rose gold and the colour is simply outstanding\\n \\neverything is good\\n \\ndon’t us it for gaming\\n \\nit’s working nicely and smoothly (like butter) right now. been using it for 6 months now.big pros: smoothness, 👌🏻 aesthetics, fantastic integration with my cellphone & other ecosystem devices e.g. airpods, sound free/fan free (literally) cool operationbig cons: price (not sure if its vfm in india for such a pricey cost unless it runs smoothly for minimum of 5-6 years), camera quality, low space given, low ram & its feature of swapping onto ssd rom which will wear/fail it out sooner.above average: battery, screen quality, sound.below average: battery- if you use non-apple apps like chrome on it much, lack of i/o ports is frustrating, the tight ecosystem which stifles flexibility and options for the user.overall, it’s fine till now. i remember i started having issue with my previous machine (dell) within a year (charging cable/battery/screen) and then it repeated every 3 years; so i have long term to go before finally giving my verdict for this m1 macbook.\\n  \\nthe macbook air is really cool and works without any glitches. some personal learnings for me. if you want to install ms teams, without a second thought go for 512 gb configuration as teams is asking for 263gb space on the hard disk which is more than what the default 256 gb. second learning is about safari stopping auto refresh for sites like trading view charts, to save power. need to explore how to disable such power saving for browser.\\n \\ni liked the usability of the laptop, super speedy and pretty\\n \\nas accepted\\n \\nwtf range man..😎\\n \\ni got 512gb/8gb macbook air for mostly programming and development related tasks. but it\\'s not good enough to handle multiple applications. i run chrome and intellij simultaneously and it hangs too much. the worst thing is you can\\'t even upgrade your ram. frustrated.\\n \\nnice product. sleek, nice screen, battery power. first time apple user. can already see the difference in the screen clarity switching from pc. also battery life is better in mac. i\\'m finally using the laptop the way its used to function - without cord. my old pc drains so much battery that you need to plug the wire as the day progresses. it has progressively gone worse and now needs a new battery within 4 years of use. i hope mac lasts much longer than that. its a bit pricy though but worth the price. hope it helps\\n \\ngood one\\n \\nscreen quality is more than superb...camera quality is not great but better than any other laptop in this price range...and i am completely  happy with battery life, remember its not gaming laptop..if you are planning to buy a laptop in 70k range , spend some money extra and buy this product.\\n \\nextremely light and slim in size. display is truly amazing. best battery life. loved it. ❤️\\n \\nthis product was delivered in only one day and with the m1 chip this the fastest laptop i have ever used go for it without  a second choice\\n \\nthis machine truly deserves the price tag we pay. we often think that apple products are super expensive, and yes, they are, but they provide extraordinary value.1-like the very high quality ssd that runs at 3000mbps,2-built like a tank with such a thin form factor,3-and speakers, man, you never\\xa0had speakers on a laptop ever like that. they are just perfect.4-the screen is a 2k with very good brightness and the best possible colour accuracy.\\xa0i guess at this price, no other brand offers this level of display.5-the battery needs no introduction; it\\'s above\\xa016 hours in my\\xa0tests, .6-and the m1, again, a laptop with this cpu can even be compared\\xa0with a high-end desktop,7-and as for the last macos, it\\'s the most polished os i\\'ve ever used.everything you get on an apple product is of very high quality.\\n \\nperfect laptop for students.cons= no usb po \\nmy first mac, so far had no issues, in 15 days hanged once for 15 secs during shutdown, else everything is good. absolutely no noise and no heating. battery backup average 9-10 hours for moderate usage (browsing, movie, youtube, streaming etc). if pocket permits then you can have this blindly without even attempt to comparing with other pc.updates on 14th apr\\'22well! performance is still good but a big problem appeared in battery. randomly shutting down with 74% battery left without any warning. it doesn\\'t turn on until i plug the power adapter. when the laptop opens it shows battery at 11% and takes very little time (10-15 mins) to reach 100% battery level. then after i unplug, from 100% to reach 74% it takes normal time (no abrupt drainage here), but once it goes around 74% it again shuts down, and the loop continues. however no problem while keeping on power. but this is not good sign from such a costly device. not sure on if battery is required to be replaced. if someone knows a solution please let me know, this may help others also. cheers !\\n  \\nawesome product (except the camera, it sucks in room regardless of how much light u provide but pretty good when you are in sunlight - don\\'t know how)sound quality is excellent!lightning speed i feel hahahtrackpad is killer 😜ps - first time mac user\\n \\n                    the media could not be loaded.\\n                \\xa0it\\'s serving its purpose that\\'s more than enough for me.screen quality is superb.really loved the sound.i read some bad reviews, i was worried but it\\'s a great deal overall, i don\\'t face any issues yet.also, i confirmed with apple with warranty and all that stuff, everything is alright.recently bought portronics m31c and it\\'s serving it\\'s purpose well.most importantly i got it for 79k\\n \\nskipping the technical part since i\\'m sure most know about the m1 chip already. as a first time mac user, i would say, switching to mac from windows was a very good experience for me. i didn\\'t face any major issues. all i can say is that for professional and non-gaming use, this device is a monster. 11 hours of battery life easily, with video calls and multiple tabs and apps, along with windows on parallels on, the whole working day! i never felt that i lacked anything. even when there were power cuts, you can easily tether your phone or even better if you have an iphone, and still keep going as if the power is still on.from performance to battery life, design, everything is amazing. but do know that you\\'ll need to keep an extra 10 thousand rupees spare to get accessories which are essential, such as cover, hubs etc. but overall a great buy as a minimum 5 year investment, and you can still expect some resale value. i was bit disappointed with the amazon delivery executive though, he simple left the item with the watchman without taking the otp and he then calls up for it. but apart from this, a great purchase!\\n \\ngood product i liked\\n \\nit is obviously the best in this segment far better than any other widows laptop you have used.\\n \\ni love this products battery. it will be use 18 hrs continuously for coding purpose without playing any songs or movie.\\n \\ni was very happy with my decision to go with apple instead of other brands. it is very handy to work and move along, no heating issues at all, battery life is unbelievable, almost for 15 hours plus, which is very convenient. it’s life expectancy is more than other brands, a quality product with neat finish and looks very premium. only downside is usb hubs, one need to buy an usb c external hub. thanks apple for making such a great product apple macbook air m1.camera not tested yet.\\n \\nhaving used dell/hp laptops only this was the first mac experience. below are the observations:1. buying from amazon - got 5900 off on mrp plus another 6000 through credit card plus same day delivery. checked the serial number online and its a genuine product. thanks amazon.2. user experience - switches on instantly, very light weight, screen is quad hd and you just cannot take your eyes of this machine. compared to windows the mac experience is very smooth.3. must say the previous hp laptops i bought had issues with numeric keys not working or taking ages to load and frequent windows patches requiring restarts. with mac there is no compromise on quality.4. this has 2 ports only. the screen quality and trackpad are so good i ditched my plan to connect to external monitor dell p2419h and logitech keyboard. only use a m590 logitech bluetooth mouse out of habit though one can do without it as well. in fact with this you dont need anything else on your table and can keep it clean.all i can say is having used this mac its well worth the price and way better than all the windows laptops in the market. beware once you use this you would probably not want to touch a windows laptop again.\\n \\nthis machine is a beast performance wise. i see a considerable amount of performance and power packed in m1. loving it..\\n \\ni\\'m writing this after 2 weeks of usage..i was a windows user before..if you\\'re going to spend ₹60k+ for a laptop, and if you\\'re able to spend a little more, macbook air would be the best option..it\\'ll never be a regret.it\\'s such an amazing machine.on time delivery and well packed..i got a genuine apple product.you can\\'t compare it\\'s performance with even ₹1l windows laptop..\\n \\nwriting this review after 3 weeks of purchase. laptop is brand new and working great. no problem or issues with the performance (run benchmark test), you can easily do multitasking without any lag/delay. since i am a software developer i tried with 6-7 microservices running side by side on the ide. all were running smoothly.the battery last long for approx 12-13 hrs of continuous use without shut down.slightly disappointed with the web cam, it\\'s 720p, but better than other brands with same resolution.overall a great experience with a great brand. go for it.\\n \\ngo for it\\n \\nexcellent product\\n \\nif you are a person who ever thought of buying a high performance laptop at a great bargain, this is it ! an apple mac with alien tech capable of competing with i9 processor at a price of that processor unit alone. got it with a great discount and exchange price making my choice a bliss.speed - amazing - 10/10finally a laptop which will say \"bring it on\"sound -  awesome - 10/10watch a movie an experience apple magic. i felt that surround sound so many times.display - kickass - 10/10i was unsure to whether i will like this 13.3)ease of use -

where the charger was since i didn\\'t charge it for two days straight.\\n \\ngreat\\n \\nvery good battery backup and according to be better than pro if compared according to price. using it for coding.\\n \\naltogether different experience for the people who habituated windows and then start with mac os.  so far, good.a tiny and light weight laptop makes you feel very comfortable as it can be carried very easily with flexibility.\\n \\na big steal for the price...so happy for the purchase\\n \\ngot delivered within 6 hours and i got it at excellent price, 60000 rs only. i have exchanged a 10 years old mac book pro and applied bank offers and got it for flat 60k.best in class performance.\\n \\nvery good product\\n \\nthis is the second apple laptop which i have purchased after macbook pro 2015 retina model and due to budget constraint i went with mca istead mbp. but still this mca has blown away my mind all thanks to m1 chip. great display quality, sleek design, light weight, super speed, good sound quality are some of the pros of this product. all together it was good purchase decision hence go for it and you\\'ll never regret the purchase. but remeber officially this is mac os and not windows os.\\n \\ngood laptop, but ms excel do not work as compared to windows os. alt shortcuts do not works through mac os, that irretate me a lot..good sound, display, build, aluminium body,,,\\n \\nthe best, the fastest, the lightest (in its category), hardcore performer and best at its versatility. thank you amazon for making it the best deal. acquired it for 90k with zero cost emi for 6 months. delivery on spot, rather received it early, in a well packed package. the delivery agent handed it over with the best ability as he knew its a high ticket parcel.\\n \\nit is worth every penny.i have my work laptop hp elitebook 360 of rs. 1.5 lakhs, but it heats when i\\'m not using it, but this macbook does not heat when using extremely. during the update, it heats up a little.it will take to get used to mac os, if you\\'re a long time windows user.screen quality is amazing, sound is also good.\\n \\nits my dream laptop ...battery backup is unbelievable compared to windows laptop ...if u can afford it.u can absolutely go for it\\n \\nupgrades were anyway required for the air product line. as expected apple provided a good update likepros:2k screenfigure

email stuff along with netflix prime and hotstar, overall a great product value for money\\n \\nenjoying it, especially typing on this one is a pleasure.\\n \\nbesides being a beauty and extremely lightweight, this laptop is full of features which put it ahead of all other laptops.1. battery life - easily lasts for entire day even with continuous usage. with 4-6 hrs usage, the battery can last for upto 3 days. you dont have to lug the charger everywhere with the laptop.other laptops dont even come close.2. speakers- great surround sound speakers make listening to music/watching movies a great experience/3. speed - the startup and apps are superfast.\\n \\nthe m1 chip has brought a revolution in the apple eco system. macbook air has been my favorite product i have been using it since 2016 when decided to upgrade it after my system started slowing down during multi task. the new laptop gives me satisfaction and value for money. hope it stays with me for the next 5 years.\\n \\nwonderful product\\n \\nswift and perfect\\n \\nprobably the only value for money apple product. just go for it. the best laptop for software developers.\\n \\nit is a great product, works very

appletruly i love it build quality great performance great speakers are awsome.\\n \\ngood buy\\n \\nbase storage should be 512gb. and base ram should be 16gb for pricey device like macbook. apple needs to move macbook air manufacturing to india like iphone.\\n \\nbest macbook for everyday use\\n \\neasily the best laptop i have used ever. it’s super fast just as your iphone.\\n \\nnothing is better as far as quality, technology, ease of working and all is concerned when it comes to apple. really nice . 256 gb very good for normal routine usage.\\n \\nthe macbook air 2020 with m1 chip is definitely a great laptop to buy for personal usage. its a premium quality machine with great aesthetics and immensely powered by the m1 chip. however, i was a bit disheartened when i came to know that lots of applications have blocked the m1 chip and you cannot install them in this machine (like instagram, netflix etc). overall it might look a costly one to buy, but if you are okay with macos then this is the best thing that comes in 93,000 inr. dell xps with similar configuration is costlier than this. go check youtube reviews for this machine to know more in details. its your hard-earned money so make sure you invest in the right stuff.\\n \\nthe best laptop below 1 lakh, if you don\\'t game. that\\'s it. superb display, out of the world battery. in my three charges, it went 16, 12 and 15 hours respectively. that\\'s insane. it\\'s blazing fast in everything. almost every app now supports native m1 chip.apple has done a wonderful job, and it\\'s completely value-for-momey.\\n \\npros:excellent built qualitythin and lightfast processorsharing with my apple phone is a delighteverything good about applecons:connectors - only 2 type c ports on this, needs to buy a connector devicenoticed a bit of heat while editing a 4gb video footage.needs a little bit adapting if migrating from a windows ecosystem\\n \\ngood for developers, students and video editors. don\\'t expect gaming for sure.\\n \\nthe upgrade was pretty long overdue. got at a very good price due to the festive season and got decent exchange price for my 7 year old mcb air 11 inch. had to spend around 10 k for additional accessories to switch from usb a to usb c, and another 8 k for the new office. so the overall cost of ownership is close to a lakh. this will last for quite a while so every penny worth it.\\n \\napple products are always value of money !\\n \\nnice one. value for money. must buy\\n \\nnice quality\\n \\nexcellent machine! the battery life is better than your mobile phone 8hrs on heavy usage 12hrs on medium and more on just light usage.but you have to spend extra on usb type c hub for more ports. this is a big draw back and you have to buy ms office separately. just include it into your budget.need not to go for 16gb ram even for video editing or gaming. 8gb works great and there is no heating issue at all, save your bucks. best among the lot. in today\\'s date m1 processor is the best as per the performance and wattage consumption.i will recommend it.\\n \\nfirst....i was getting nervous ...should i buy from amazon or from store.....finally made decision and ordered from amazon......its 100% original product...i have chacked everything, every youtube trick to find that the product is genuine  or not....it\\'s 100% original product and got every benefits  like 1 year warranty and apple care service......\\n \\nnice experience\\n \\ngreat product at good price.\\n \\nfinally got my dream book 😍totally value for money, easy to carry.\\n \\npro1.battery : more than 15hr in day to day software development use.2. exilent performance3. best build quality4. instant open5. most secure6. trackpad you will love itcons:1. m1 chip not support all the software.( it will improve with time).2. keyboard ( it sucks. specially if you are typing for long time. no key travel)3. ram (go for for 16gb i have done this mistake. it will help you on longer run)4. if you are planning to do longer work like ( video editing, machine learning or deep learning) it will heat  a lot ( go for pro version )5. you have to buy office :)\\n \\nit\\'s just awesome one word is enough ..i moved from windows to mac , so it was difficult to understand but after 1 day it was just superb.but about the heating i cnt say much now will update review once in summer condition .but battery is more than enough, works like makkhan\\n \\nhas been 3 months. so far looks good. no lag, using multiple apps at a time for coding. battery lasts around 8-10 hours on wifi + youtube + ~6 chrome tabs + vscode all way.possible cons:battery is great but lasts less than macbook prokeyboard seems of low quality\\n \\npros:-1. it\\'s superfast. it will feel fast on everything - from bootup, to app opening, to builds etc.2. it\\'s slim. air has no fan hence it\\'s form factor is even slimmer than pro.3. it remains cold even during heavy code builds. it\\'s hard to find things which makes it warm actually.4. i have tried several graphics heavy games and they run great without any heat as well5. if you are just browsing with wifi on, typically it loses 10% battery in 7-8 hours. but it\\'s for safari browser. it has achieved i guess what people will call power-efficiency nirvana.6. screen, sound and mic quality are awesomecons:-1. since it\\'s winters in india now, some people might not like that it doesn\\'t heat up the surroundings2. for longer workloads - like if you are doing daily large video compressions/conversions and that takes like 15-20 mins, then this machine will not work as fast as pro; as that\\'s not the load it\\'s optimised for. but ask yourself - whether you are gonna do that at all.3. camera is 720p and that sucks about every other laptop as well. but apple has brought some software optimisations which will make it look better4. it doesn\\'t make sound of fan, so you might feel asleep if you are used that to keep track of your ml jobs.apple started a revolution with this. go for it, it\\'s worth it.\\n \\ncamera quality is very poor but overall a good laptop to buy\\n \\nthere is nothing to dislike about apple\\'s m1 line. takes a month or two to get used to all the gestures, especially for a macbook virgin like me.\\n \\ngreat quality - takes some time getting used to, if you’ve been using windows pc/laptop!premium product\\n \\ni have been using for about two weeks and i am very happy with the performance this laptop gives.there are only three things which i’m not comfortable with,1. when you open the laptop, you will need both hands, one to hold down the base part of the laptop and another to hold the lid else you will lift the laptop instead of opening.2. the caps lock key is bit tight to press, not like other keys. but it still works fine, i just have to press a little harder then i press other keys. i don’t think this is an issue with all the macbook.3. the usb ports are to closed to each other. it gives me some problem when i wanted two usb device in a same time.other then these, i am very happy.\\n \\nbest value for money laptop.i got it around 81k(10k bank offer +14.5k exchange offer) with 512gb ssd and 8gb ram.so far satisfied with the product as i use my laptop for coding practices(web and android application development)\\n \\nbut performance is not as expected\\n \\ni am writing this review after a month of purchase. the apple m1 chip makes everything so much better. a lot of people told me that macbook air m1 is very close to the pro. now i see why. the battery life is shockingly too good for an apple device. i use the laptop for browsing, emails, watching content and ms office; all of this runs flawlessly on this machine. the design is beautiful. the photos don’t do justice to the actual gold colour. i brought gold because space grey wasn’t available even after a long wait but i’m glad that happened because this is a rose gold colour and it looks splendid.this machine is worth every penny even without discounts, but if you get it with some credit card discount or good exchange deal like i did, don’t wait at all.\\n \\ni am so happy to get it from here! got great discounts! which were not even available on apple stores! also got silver color! which was apparently unavailable in mumbai!\\n \\ni am not a programmer or a graphic designer but i needed this for coursework and statistical analysis. the battery seems to be everlasting and i charge it once in 2 days and even that is super fast. the weight is light and the ergonomics is great. the macbook interface is just great and you won’t regret this purchase. it took me a day to get used to it, being a previous windows user but everyday i discover new hidden features and it’s great. don’t buy it to show off but buy it for the absolute workhorse that it is.\\n \\namazing performance where the camera quality disappoints\\n \\nworthy of penny\\n \\ni took lot of time to take a decision to invest money on this laptop. finally, i\\'m very much happy that it exceeded my expectations.pros:good batterysounddisplaykeyboardcons:camera quality (but with proper lighting, its not a major issue)cost of accessories.\\n \\nthis is my first macbook. i am not a video editor or software professional. so can speak about the design and overall performance only. it’s good enough for my daily office works and browsing. only thing i required was office tools like excel, word and powerpoint, that was not there but i purchased office 365 and managed it. i think response time is pretty more comparing to my previous hp intel i5 10th gen. but overall it’s good looking and very handy. battery life is excellent no words to say, similarly video clarity and sound is also awesome. apple was dream for me and now i owned it.\\n \\nthe main difference from intel chip macbook is that m1 chip macbook air is always 3-4 degrees cooler, it gives you better battery life.also sound quality of this macbook is amazing.it’s high time apple did something another the web cam. compared to any iphone, macbook webcam is very primitive!\\n \\ni have been using the product for the past two weeks or so and literally there is no negative aspect with this product. only thing which could have been better is the usb ports.otherwise one could just close your eyes and simply go on for it ! best price to value laptop for sure !!!\\n \\ni feel motivated using this super fast machine, i switched from dell (intel core 2 duo) ;)\\n \\nit is good and worth for money. it is not comparable to any one\\n \\nwhat can one say, it\\'s a must have for anyone who loves more than 5 feet away from a switch board. just buy it and get it over with, don\\'t overthink.\\n \\n                    the media could not be loaded.\\n                \\xa0very light weight and smooth finish. loving every bit. wonderful sound quality and awesome features. apple is love\\n \\npros:- battery life - no other laptop with this form factor comes near to this one.- performance - with the m1 chip processor from apple, software and hardware work together like magic.- no fan for cooling the processor, so super silent.- compact and lightweight.- mac oscons:- normal limitations related to mac os (for example, gaming).recommendation:the best apple laptop period.  go for it if you are not a gamer or dependent on software exclusive to windows.\\n \\n                    the media could not be loaded.\\n                \\xa0if you like apple 🍎 go buy it.. could easily run for more than 5 years.. btw i am not in picture\\n \\nthe best value for money laptop\\n \\nwell this is my first mac book!it\\'s been more than 2 weeks!  so far i have no complaints. laptop boots up within 10 secs, battery life lasts more than 3 days. i have been doing basic stuff like browsing, connecting my ssd to transfers and watching movies to videos. i am not sure if its worth the money though as its pretty expensive for the basic model which is 86900 inr. as we know already its a fan less model, it literally has zero noise, it\\'s gets very little warm on the surface after and hour or two of usage.  will give an complete review post 2 months.\\n \\ni am reviewing after using one month.its battery life,screen quality,performance is best and very light weight laptop.\\n \\nthe best thing about apple is that it wont compromise on any spec’s. it has a great battery life with 15 hours plus screen on time. best in its price. i’m very much satisfied with my purchase.\\n \\ngreat screenno issues yet\\n \\nthe speed with which native apps open is amazing, the battery life is fantastic.you will need to spend more money on the right connectors etc, especially if you want a desktop setup. my thunderbolt 2 monitor has a lot of usb-a ports to connect my mouse and keyboard and all i had to get was the (rather expensive) apple thunderbolt 3 to thunderbolt 2 connector for rs 4,500 (which i paid for with my amazon card cashback). there are no third-party options. made more sense (given my needs) than spending rs 6,000+ on a flimsy usb-c hub or rs 12,000 on a usb-c dock like the dell d6000. thunderbolt docks in india are overpriced and unnecessary if you don\\'t need the speed.\\n \\nit is truly a amazing experience using m1 mac air .. superb quality and superb performance of official and professional work music recording and editing videos\\n \\nhad some issues around delivery but finally managed to get this. have been a macbook air user so difficult for others to replicate its overall performance.\\n \\nwithin a month of the use trackpad stopped working. at that time apple care told me now it cannot be exchanged/replaced as the replacement window is over. i left with only choice of getting the hardware replaced. now again within a year same issue, the trackpad has stopped working. even worst i need to pay for new part this time as the warranty has expired. i bought this for my daughter\\'s study and uage is very minimal. it doesn\\'t seem like using apple product. feel like cheated!!\\n \\napple being apple, everything is excellent. however,  i ordered spaceport but amazon delivered gold. as i got with good discount,  i had to live with it.\\n \\nthis laptop i\\'ve got it for 75k with hdfc offers, which is the best deal. also, battery backup is simply amazing and with rest of the device am sure all by now know it has an awesome screen. however the only expectation is apple to quickly load apps customized to m1 into their store or atleast most used ones. overall build quality is 10/10, screen 10/10, performance 10/10, support 9/10, battery 10/10, sound quality 8/10, value for money 9/10.\\n \\ndefinitely a good choice for a first macbook purchase.\\n \\ncons:1. logo doesn\\'t glow as expected.2. there is no extra 8gb gpu. this is just a false statement used for marketing.pros:1. got the expected colour, space grey2. excellent battery life3. speaker sound quality amazing4. fast processor.\\n \\n                    the media could not be loaded.\\n                \\xa0just amazing\\n  \\njust seems small and average camera, rest everything is amazing\\n \\nthe best laptop i have ever used! i switched from windows to apple for the very first time. and it was worth it. this piece begs you to keep working! the most significant plus point is definitely battery life. i charged it on one saturday night and with daily usage of nearly 1-2 hours of youtube and coding, till next sunday it was at 19%. just mind-blowing!display is awesome, sound is awesome too!definitely worth it\\n \\nthe m1 based macbook air is simply the best laptop you can buy right now. with the macbook pro also using the m1 it\\'s the first time in years that the air\\'s specs are almost identical to the pro\\'s at a much lower price point. for those worried most common applications like chrome are already available native for m1. other non native apps also work flawlessly.pros:1. noiseless2. high screen clarity3. battery life of 3-5 days on average use4. very light5. fingerprint sensor6. keyboard is so nice you feel like typing morecons:1. not a big fan of
